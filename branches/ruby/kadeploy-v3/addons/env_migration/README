Here is a Ruby script designed to migrate the Kadeploy environment from version 2.1.* to version 3.

$>./env_migrate -h
 Usage: ruby env_migrate.rb [options]
 Contact: kadeploy-devel@lists.grid5000.fr

 General options:
  -e, --env-name NAME          Environment name
  -f, --env-file FILE          Environment file
  -k, --env-kind KIND          Environment kind (linux|xen|other)


It can be used as follows:
 * $>./env_migrate -e envname_in_kaenvironments_db -k linux
 * $>./env_migrate -f envfile_in_2_1_x_format -k xen

The new environment description is printed on stdout.

You must choose to load the old environment description either from the kaenvironments database with the -e switch or from a file with the -f switch.
In all the cases, you must use the -k switch to choose the environment kind. The supported values are:
 - linux: classic linux based environment
 - xen: xen hypervisor
 - other: any other environment like the FreeBSD based environments.
