    <title>HOW</title>    
    <para>
      To deploy an os you must have it installed somewhere...      
    </para>
    <para>
      Linux has a very good support.
      You have to tar the filesystem in a tarball, with a command like <command>tar czvlf /pathto/environment.tgz /</command>
      and record an environment with karecordenv (1).
    </para>

    <para>
      For any other OS you have to install it on a node.
      A great number of OS need to be installed on a primary partition (not logical one).
      When you have install it, you have to dump the partition on a file.

    </para>
    <para>
      Example, If you have installed a FreeBSD on the first partition of your first hardrive, 
      you have to reboot your node to a different OS (the deployment system for example with kareboot),
      then <command> cat /dev/hda1 > /pathto/environment.dd</command>.
      If you want to gzip it (better network performance in deployment, and in size),
      with </command> cat /dev/hda1 | gzip -c > /pathto/environment.dd.gz</command>.
    </para>
