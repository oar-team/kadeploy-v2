    <title>WHAT</title>
    <para>
      Kadeploy can currently deploy Linux, *BSD, Solaris, MSDOS, Windows (and all other OS on x86 computer).
      The forces of kadeploy, is the speed of deployment.
      Deploying one computer is almost has fast as deploying hundred computer.
      An os is pipeline from the first computer to the last to get the best network bandwith.
    </para>

    <para>
      Currently you can installed it on any linux and deploy the OS you want.
      *BSD will be supported soon, then Solaris and windows.

    <title>HOW</title>    
    <para>
      To deploy an os you must have it installed somewhere...      
    </para>
    <para>
      Linux has a very good support.
      You have to tar the filesystem in a tarball, with a command like <command>tar czvlf /pathto/environment.tgz /</command>
      and record an environment with karecordenv (1).
    </para>

    <para>
      For any other OS you have to install it on a node with your hand ;)
      A great number of OS need to be installed on a primary partition (not logical one).
      When you have install it, you have to dump the partition on a file.
      Then karecordenv (1) it.
    </para>

    <para>
      Example, If you have installed a FreeBSD on the first partition of your first hardrive, 
      you have to reboot your node to a different OS (the deployment system for example with kareboot),
      then <command> cat /dev/hda1 > /pathto/environment.dd</command>.
      If you want to gzip it (better network performance in deployment, and in size),
      with </command> cat /dev/hda1 | gzip -c > /pathto/environment.dd.gz</command>.
    </para>
