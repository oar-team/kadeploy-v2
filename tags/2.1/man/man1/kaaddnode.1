DESCRIPTION
    
.PP
kaaddnode registers nodes and their disk and partition features for them to be available to the deployment system\&. It can be used at the very beginning to describe a whole cluster (after having completed the installation for instance) or later when new nodes are added to a cluster already managed by the deployment system\&.

.PP
info_file is the name of the file that describes all the information the system needs\&. It contains two main parts and has to be formacommanded as described below:

.nf

# first part : node set description

node_name1    mac_address1    ip_address1
node_name2    mac_address2    ip_address2
node_name3    mac_address3    ip_address3
\&.\&.\&.           \&.\&.\&.             \&.\&.\&.
	
.fi

.PP
N\&.B\&. : each node is described on a separate line; fields on each line are separated by tabs or spaces\&.

.nf

# second part : descriptive information about the type of disk and the partitioning

device_name    device_size
partition_number1    partition_size1    deployed_env1
partition_number2    partition_size2    deployed_env2
	      partition_number3    partition_size3    deployed_env3
\&.\&.\&.		     \&.\&.\&.		\&.\&.\&.

.fi

.PP
N\&.B\&. : each partition is described on a separate line; fields on each line are separated by tabs or spaces\&. All size are given in Mbytes\&. The specified deployed_env should already exist in the deployment system otherwise default value 'undefined' will be switched to the declared one during the execution\&. First and second part are separated by a \- strange and arbitrary \- line starting with the following characters : \\#\&. Empty lines and commentaries (starting with #) are ignored\&. Before doing any modification in the deployment system database, kaaddnode tries to check if the expected description syntax is respected in both parts\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.PP
with description\&.txt as below:
