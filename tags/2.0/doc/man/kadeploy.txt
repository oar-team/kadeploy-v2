	 It needs critic variables to be defined in the /etc/kadeploy/deploy.conf configuration file ; see configuration file section for further details.

OPTIONS
	 -e, --environment environment_name
		the name of the environment to deploy.

	 -m, --machine hostname
		specifies a host. This option can be used more than once to specify several hosts. By default, it tries to deploy on all the nodes.

CONFIGURATION FILES
	/etc/kadeploy/deploy.conf
		Contains variables that should be defined prior to the command execution. These variables are grouped into several sections. A very short description is available for each variable and sometimes example values are given in commentary. The file is read once at the beginning of the execution and prior to any other action. If values are missing, it will be told as precisely as possible.
		The syntax is as follow :

		        # section_name #
		    	# ------------ #
		
			# short description
			var_name1 = var_value1	# example_value

			# short description
			var_name2 = var_value2	# example_value

			...

		Also, an example of this file can be found at in the tools/cookbook/ folder.

	/etc/kadeploy/deploy_cmd.conf
		Contain entries describing reboot command needed for deployment. See kareboot man page for further details.

FILES
	kadeploy needs read and write access to several folder and files into to acheive a deployment. These rights should be granted to the deploy user. Here are the files and folder list :
		 - $KADEPLOYDIR/boot/ contains utilities (binaries etc.) for grub/pxe/reboot stories
		 - the tftp folder    where grub and pxe files will be written
		 - and /tmp/	      for a few temporary files

EXAMPLE
	kadeploy -e debian -m node7 -p hda3	 	# deploys the debian on partition hda3 of node 7
	kadeploy -e debian -m node1 -m node2 -p hdb6	# deploys the debian on partition hdb6 of nodes 1 and 2
