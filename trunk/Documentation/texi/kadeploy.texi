@node Motivation
@section The background of Kadeploy design

Every HPC facility needs a system to efficiently install and upgrade the @abbr{OS, operating system} deployed on the nodes.
The first version of Kadeploy was designed to deploy efficiently a large set of nodes at once:
the cluster's system  administrator was able to deploy one OS on a set of nodes, 
this system is then homogeneous on all the nodes for users and users can submit 
jobs on parts of the cluster. For upgrades, and global software installation, the system 
administrator proceeds this way:
@table @b
@item isolate a node
take a compute node out of reach of users to let them work on the rest of the cluster 
nodes, this node is often called the golden node.
@item install/upgrade the node OS
at the end of this step, the node OS should be the desired OS for all the cluster nodes
@item isolate another node and update it
deploy the new version of the OS on a single node to test the deployment procedure, 
if something goes wrong, adapt consequently the OS on the golden node and retry deployment
@item isolate all the nodes and update them
deploy the new version of the OS on all the nodes of the cluster at once
@item test and give the nodes back
test if users can use the nodes and let them use the nodes back, by registering 
them as free in the cluster batch scheduler, for example.
@end table

This method of deployment, is a taken as a specific case: single user (only one user deploys here: administrator), single cluster (only one cluster targetted by the OS upgrade), single operating system deployment (there is only one OS per node).

Kadeploy 2 was developped to be able to deal with all the other cases, from this simple 
classic one to multi-users, multi-clusters, multi-OS including all the possible mixes.

@node Architecture
@section The target architecture

Kadeploy is primarily targeted at x86 and x86_64 CPUs architectures, 
since they are the most common and have the largest variety of operating 
systems. However, to the extent that certain other architectures comply
with some network boot technologies described further, kadeploy can be 
adapted for those needs (there is a IA64 version for kadeploy). Please let 
me know if you are interested in specific versions.

@node Operating systems
@section The target operating systems

The targeted operating systems are the ones running on the architectures 
defined in @ref{Architecture}, and mainly the ones often used in HPC world.
Kadeploy was primarily designed to deploy Linux and then FreeBSD, NetBSD and Solaris.


@node Terminology
@chapter The definitions of terms used through the documentation

@table @dfn
@item environment
We use the term @dfn{environment}, as an entity that can be deployed using kadeploy, 
or something that is deployed on a hard drive partition.

@item shared partition
We use the term @dfn{shared partition}, when a partition defined on the node's 
local hard driver can be shared between several environments deployed 
on different partitions of the node.
