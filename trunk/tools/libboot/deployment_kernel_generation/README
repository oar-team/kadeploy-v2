Here is a script designed to generate a deployment kernel for kadeploy 2.1.6.

Before launching, you must customize it by setting the following values:
-KERNEL_CONFIG : absolute path to a kernel config file
-KERNEL_VERSION : version of the kernel (eg. 2.6.21.2)
-OUTPUT_KERNEL : name of the generated kernel (absolute path)
-OUTPUT_INITRD : name of the generated initrd (absolute path)

You can also customize INITRD_SIZE (if your kernel is bigger or smaller than 35Mo) and NUMBER_OF_CPU.

Then, with root rights just execute: ./generate_deployment_kernel.sh

Normally, the script will download the kernel on kernel.org. If you want, it is possible to stop the execution in order to configure the downloaded kernel (for instance if you think that your config file is not good) by runing something like "make config" or "make menuconfig". When the script will be relaunched, it won't download again the kernel.

In your config file don't forget to add support for RAM disk, ext2 and cramfs:
Device Drivers  ---> Block devices  ---> <*> RAM disk support
Device Drivers  ---> Block devices  ---> [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
File systems  ---> <*> Second extended fs support
File systems  ---> <*> ROM file system support 
File systems  ---> Miscellaneous filesystems  ---> Compressed ROM file system support (cramfs)

Don't forget to edit the label_deploy line of the deploy.conf file in order to adjust the ramdisk_size. For instance: label_deploy = mykernel:myinitrd ETH_DRV=tg3 ETH_DEV=eth0 DISK_DRV=mptsas console=tty1 console=ttyS1,57600 ramdisk_size=60000 root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc rw

For information, root_fs.tar.bz2 is a minimal filesystem used to generate initrd.
