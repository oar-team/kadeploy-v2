=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to grant an user the right to log as root on a set of nodes without any password.
Kaaddkeys simply adds the specified I<public_keyfile> to root's authorized_keys file on the deployed nodes of the specified set.

Additional configuration should be done to ensure passwordless connection to remote nodes.
User should have a key without passphase, to create this:

 Host *.grid5000.fr
       StrictHostKeyChecking no
