    <title>WHAT</title>
    <para>
      Kadeploy can currently deploy Linux, *BSD, Solaris, MSDOS,
      Windows (and all other OS on x86 computer).  The forces of
      kadeploy, is the speed of deployment.  Deploying one computer is
      almost has fast as deploying hundred computer.  An os is
      pipeline from the first computer to the last to get the best
      network bandwith.
    </para>

    <para>
      Currently you can installed it only on any decent linux system and deploy the OS you want.

    <title>HOW</title>    
    <para>
      To deploy an os you must have it installed somewhere...
      kadeploy doesn't offer a clean solution for the first deployment.
    </para>

    <para>
      LINUX
    </para>
    <para>
      Linux has a very good support.
      You have to tar the filesystem in a tarball, with a command like :
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <command>ssh node tar --numeric-owner --one-file-system -zcSf - / > archive.tgz </command> 
    </para>

    <para>
      WINDOWS
    </para>
    <para>
      Windows is supported too.
      Windows need a primary partition (1-4).
      You have to install it on a FAT32 system, then "tar it" like a linux.
    </para>

    <para>
      OTHER OS
    </para>

    <para>
      A great number of OS need to be installed on a primary partition (not logical one).
      When you have install it, you have to dump the partition on a file.
      Then karecordenv (1) it.
    </para>

    <para>
      Example, If you have installed a *BSD on the first partition of your first hardrive, 
      you have to reboot your node to another OS 
      (the deployment system for example with kareset)
      then launch a command like :
    </para>

    <para>
      <command> ssh node "cat /dev/hda1 |gzip -9 " > /pathto/XBSD.dd.gz</command>
    </para>

    <para>
      You can use bzip2 too
    </para>
