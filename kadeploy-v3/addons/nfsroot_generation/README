Here is a script designed to generate a debootstrap based NFSROOT environment for kadeploy 3.

Before launching, you must customize it by setting the following values at the beginning of the script:
- DEBOOTSTRAP: path of the deboostrap binary
- NFSROOT: destination NFSROOT path
- TFTPROOT: TFTPROOT path
- KERNEL_VERSION: version of the 2.6 kernel you want
- CONFIG_FILE: path of a working config file
- TMP: temporary path
- NAMESERVER: ip of the DNS server

Then, with root rights just execute on your NFS server: sh make_nfsroot.sh.

Please note that some options must be "hard" activated in the kernel configuration ("y" value and not "m"). In particular:
- the driver of your network card (eg. CONFIG_E1000)
- CONFIG_IP_PNP
- CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP
- CONFIG_NFS_FS
- CONFIG_ROOT_NFS

A working kernel configuration file is also provided.
