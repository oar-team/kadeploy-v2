2.1.6
        * kadeploy is multicluster: possibility to define several
          `deploy.conf' configuration files 1 per cluster. This new
          possibility allows to use kadeploy on 2 clusters of the same
          site having different default partition, different default
          kernel parameters to pass, but also different timings for
          boot time, or even different databases (if environments for
          one cluster cannot be deployed on the other one).

        * custom parameters can be passed with kareboot to the deployed
          nodes.

2.1.5
        * deployment of more than 120 nodes works now: no more
          restrictions on the number of nodes (tested on GriD eXplorer
          on a full 330 nodes deployment several times), more reliable
          deployments

        * taktuk is not used anymore => every parallel command is
          issued internally using the same launcher for all apps
          (kadeploy, kareboot...) corrects many bugs (blocked
          deployments, all or nothing deployments,...).

        * support for multiple architecture environments on the same
          cluster: you can deploy x86_64 nodes or x86 nodes from a
          x86/x86_64 server for example.

        * verbose mode more verbose, and standard is far less verbose
          than before.

        * new installation method, man pages are now pods.

        * addons: karemote and kaaddkeys kaaddkeys is a model for
          developing addons: partly user mode (to read user's files),
          partly run as deploy user.

        * less dependencies for installation, less configuration
          variables.

2.1.2
        * kaenvironments (environment name by user).

        * kaenvironments (by node)

        * new partitioning format
          (`/etc/kadeploy/clusterpartition.conf' &&
          `/etc/kadeploy/clustenodes.conf').

        * new parallel command launcher (internal).

        * kasetup to help installing and configuring kadeploy.

        * fdisk scripting (kasetup).

        * katftp removed (replaced by kasetup).

        * kadelnode kaaddnode remove (replaced by kasetup).

        * kasudowrapper security enhancement.

        * optsupport deactivated.

2.1.1
        * sudowrapper.

        * kaenvironment and karecordenv improved.

        * katftp (fast installation).

        * kadatabase (fast installation).

        * optimisation support.

        * Added Changelog files.

        * Added kernel and initrd for 64 bit opteron, Sata support.

2.1
        * autoconf.

        * dd deploy method for chainloaded OS.
